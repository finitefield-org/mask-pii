## Core concepts

- **Email masking:** masks the local part while preserving the domain.
- **Phone masking:** detects common international formats and masks all digits except the last 4 while keeping separators.
- **Customizable:** configurable mask character and masking targets.

## Notes

Each language implementation documents its own installation and usage details in its respective README.
